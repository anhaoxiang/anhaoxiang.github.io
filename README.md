## About

I am Anhao Xiang, an Assistant Professor of Information Technology at the [Kennesaw State University](https://www.kennesaw.edu/ccse/academics/information-technology/index.php).
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Colorado School of Mines in 2025, under the supervision of Professor [Chuan Yue](https://people.mines.edu/chuanyue/). Before that, I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. My current research focuses on security and privacy, particularly on (1) mobile app privacy and regulatory compliance, (2) web security, and (3) usable security and privacy. For more information, please view [my CV](CV_Anhao_Public.pdf).

**I'm looking for self-motivated students (both undergraduates and graduates) who are interested in doing security & privacy research in Mobile, Web, and AI systems. Please stop by my office or send me an email with a brief introduction of yourself. Thank you!**
