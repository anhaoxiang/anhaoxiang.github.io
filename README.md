## About

Anhao Xiang is a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines (MINES), under the supervision of Professor [Chuan Yue](https://people.mines.edu/chuanyue/). His current research focuses on security and privacy, particularly on (1) mobile app privacy and regulatory compliance, (2) web security, and (3) usable security and privacy. He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT) in 2020 and 2021, respectively. He also holds a Graduate Certificate in Cybersecurity and is an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). For more information, please view [my CV](CV_Anhao_Public.pdf).

**Anhao will graduate in December 2025 and is currently on the job market.**

## Highlighted Research Projects

**Analyzing the Feasibility of Adopting CSP on the Web**  
*Accepted at IEEE/ACM ICSE 2025, second author*  
Content Security Policy (CSP) is a key security mechanism designed to mitigate injection attacks like XSS. In this project, we developed an automated crawling tool to assess adoption of Google‚Äôs four nonce-based CSP solutions across the top 10K websites. Our analysis demonstrated that most websites could feasibly adopt nonce-based CSPs. We further analyzed adoption challenges, and provided recommendations to help developers strengthen their websites against injection attacks.

**Exploring Additional Dimensions on the Adoption of CSP**  
*To appear in IEEE S&P Magazine 2025, first author*  
This article builds on the ICSE 2025 study by exploring additional dimensions, particularly developers‚Äô perspectives on the adoption of nonce-based CSP solutions, and the applicability of these solutions to websites with diverse architectures and development frameworks. We also explored the LLMs‚Äô support for adopting nonce-based CSP solutions.  

**Analyzing the GDPR Compliance of Mobile Apps‚Äô Privacy Policies**  
*Accepted at ACM CCS 2023, first author*  
In this project, we investigated the GDPR compliance of mobile apps‚Äô privacy policies. We designed the NLP framework PolicyChecker by taking a rule and semantic role based approach. Using PolicyChecker, we conducted the first large-scale analysis of mobile app privacy policies and found that 99.3% violated at least one requirement. Our analysis further revealed root causes related to developers‚Äô limited understanding of GDPR and the widespread reliance on policy generators.
